    "### Advantage of Using With Statement and open() Together:\n",
    "Advantages of using the with statement with open() include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic Resource Management: The with statement automatically takes care of opening the file and guarantees that it will be closed properly when the block of code is exited. This eliminates the need to manually call the close() method, reducing the chance of forgetting to close the file and potential resource leaks. It promotes good programming practices by ensuring that resources are managed efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception Safety: The with statement ensures that the file is closed even if an exception occurs within the block of code. It provides a built-in mechanism to handle exceptions and guarantees that the file will be closed before the exception is propagated further. This helps maintain data integrity and prevents leaving the file in an invalid or inconsistent state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Readability and Simplicity: By using the with statement, the code becomes more readable and concise. The intent of opening and closing the file is clearly indicated by the with block. It eliminates the need for separate try-except-finally blocks or manually managing the closing of the file, resulting in cleaner and more maintainable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the with statement in combination with the open() function simplifies file handling, promotes good resource management, ensures exception safety, and improves the readability of your code. It is considered the recommended approach for working with files in Python."
